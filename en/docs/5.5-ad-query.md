## 5.3. Ad Query

With the catalog synchronized, your platform requests ads to fill the ad spaces (`placements`). The request is a `POST` and the `publisher_id` must be provided in the URL.

* **Endpoint:** `POST https://newtail-media.newtail.com.br/v1/rma/:publisher_id`

### Best Practices

#### Placement Naming

Adopt a clear standard, such as `{channel}_{context}_{position}_{type}` (e.g., `msite_search_top-shelf_product`).

| channel | context | position | type | example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| site | home | middle | banner | site_home_middle_banner |
| msite | product | top-vitrine | product | msite_product_top-vitrine_product |
| app | search | top-vitrine | product | app_search_top-vitrine_product |
| app | search | top-vitrine | banner | app_search_top-vitrine_banner |
| site | category | bottom-vitrine | banner | site_category_bottom-vitrine_banner |
| site | product | filter-bar | product | site_product_filter-bar_product |

#### IAB Standard Image Sizes

For banner-type ads, it is important to use images in the standard formats defined by the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau). This ensures compatibility and a better visual experience across different sites and devices.

**Main Formats:**

*   **Medium Rectangle:** 300x250 pixels
*   **Leaderboard:** 728x90 pixels
*   **Wide Skyscraper:** 160x600 pixels
*   **Mobile Leaderboard:** 320x50 pixels
*   **Billboard:** 970x250 pixels
*   **Half Page:** 300x600 pixels

#### Video Size Options

For video ad requests, you should specify the size parameter to filter by video resolution. The available options are:

*   **1080p** (1920x1080 pixels) - Recommended only for full-screen videos
*   **720p** (1280x720 pixels) - Recommended only for full-screen videos
*   **480p** (854x480 pixels)
*   **360p** (640x360 pixels)
*   **320p** (568x320 pixels) - Recommended for mobile devices

**Important:** When requesting video ads, use only the resolution identifier (e.g., `"720p"`) in the size parameter, not the full dimensions. For example, to filter by 1280x720 resolution, use `"size": "720p"` in your ad request.

### Ad Targeting

Target ads to specific audiences to increase relevance.

#### **Real-Time Targeting**
Send demographic or audience data directly in the body of the **ad query**, in the `segmentation` field.

The `segmentation` field is an array of objects, where each object contains:
- `key`: The type of segmentation (e.g., "STATE", "CITY", "GENDER")
- `values`: Array of values for the segmentation

**Segmentation Example:**

```json
[
    {
        "key": "STATE",
        "values": [
            "CA"
        ]
    },
    {
        "key": "CITY",
        "values": [
            "San Francisco"
        ]
    }
]
```

**Available Segmentation Types:**

| Key | Description | Example Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `STATE` | User's state | "CA", "NY", "TX" |
| `CITY` | User's city | "San Francisco", "New York" |
| `GENDER` | User's gender | "M", "F" |
| `AGE` | User's age | "22", "35" |
| `AUDIENCES` | Custom audience | "high_value_customers", "cart_abandoners" |
| `NBO_CATEGORIES` | Indicates the possible categories that the user intends to buy | "Eletronics", "Books" |
