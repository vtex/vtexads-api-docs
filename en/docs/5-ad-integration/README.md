## 4. Ad Integration

This section provides detailed information on how to integrate with the VTEX Ads platform to display ads on your website. There are two main ways to integrate:

*   **[API Integration](./1-api-integration.md):** For a more customized integration, you can use our REST API to manage the entire ad lifecycle, from querying to event notification.
*   **[VTEX Integration](./2-vtex-integration.md):** If your store is on the VTEX platform, you can use our VTEX IO app to simplify the integration process.
