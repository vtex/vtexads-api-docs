# 5.5.1. Placement Naming Recommendations

Using clear, consistent placement names is essential to correctly measure the performance of each ad area on your site/app, make reporting easier, and speed up troubleshooting.

Recommended naming pattern:

```
{channel}_{context}_{position}_{type}
```

Where:
- channel: access channel, e.g., site, msite (mobile site), app
- context: page/navigation context, e.g., home, category, search, product, brand_page, digital_signage
- position: block location on the page, e.g., top-vitrine, middle, bottom-vitrine, filter-bar
- type: creative type, e.g., product, banner, sponsored_brand

Best practices:
- Use lowercase and no spaces (use hyphen for compounds, e.g., top-vitrine).
- Avoid obscure abbreviations; keep consistency across pages and channels.
- The name should be stable over time (do not include dates, campaign names, etc.).

Examples:

| channel | context | position | type | example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| site | home | middle | banner | site_home_middle_banner |
| msite | product | top-vitrine | product | msite_product_top-vitrine_product |
| app | search | top-vitrine | product | app_search_top-vitrine_product |
| app | search | top-vitrine | banner | app_search_top-vitrine_banner |
| site | category | bottom-vitrine | banner | site_category_bottom-vitrine_banner |
| site | product | filter-bar | product | site_product_filter-bar_product |

Note: Use the same channel and context values you send in Ad Query (5.5) to keep traceability between requests and reports.
