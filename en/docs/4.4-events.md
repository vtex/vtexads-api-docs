## 4.3. Events

Event notification is **crucial** for attribution and measurement.

#### Best Practices

* **HTTP Persistence:** Use persistent HTTP connections (`Connection: keep-alive` in the header) to optimize performance.
* **Timeout:** Implement a timeout of 500-600ms on ad query calls to avoid harming the user experience.
* **Placement Naming:** Adopt a clear standard, such as `{channel}_{context}_{position}_{type}` (e.g., `msite_search_top-shelf_product`).

#### **User and Session Identification**

* **`session_id`:** User session ID. Required in all events. Must be consistent throughout the Browse session.
* **`user_id`:** Unique customer ID on the platform, consistent across channels. Required in the conversion event.

#### **Impression, View, and Click Notification**

Send a `POST` request to the respective event URL (`impression_url`, `view_url`, `click_url`) provided in the ad query, with a JSON body containing `user_id` and `session_id`.

* **Content-Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* **Recommended Method (Browser):** Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` to ensure asynchronous sending without blocking navigation.
* **Success Response:** `HTTP 202 Accepted`.

#### **Conversion Notification**

When a purchase is completed, send the order data.

* **Endpoint:** `POST https://events.newtail-media.newtail.com.br/v1/beacon/conversion`
* **Content-Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* **Request Body:** The object must contain the order data. The item price should not be multiplied by the quantity.

| Order Field | Description | Type | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `publisher_id` | Publisher ID. | String | Yes |
| `user_id` | ID of the user who made the purchase. | String | Yes |
| `session_id` | Session ID of the purchase. | String | Yes |
| `order_id` | Order ID. | String | Yes |
| `email_hashed` | User's email in hash format (SHA256). | String | Yes |
| `created_at` | Order date/time (ISO 8601 in UTC). | String | Yes |
| `items` | List of order items. | Array[Item] | Yes |
| `phone_hashed`| User's phone in hash (SHA256). | String | No (Recommended) |
| `social_id_hashed`| User's Tax ID (CPF/CNPJ) in hash (SHA256). | String | No (Recommended) |

#### **Attribution and Deduplication Rules**

* **Conversion Window:** The period after an interaction during which a sale can be attributed to the ad.
    * **Click (for `product`):** 14 days.
    * **View (for `display`/`video`):** 14 days.
* **Event Deduplication:** For the same user and ad, events are ignored for a period.
    * **Impressions:** 1 minute.
    * **Clicks:** 1 hour.
    * **Conversions:** Are not deduplicated (unless the same `order_id` is sent again within 30 days).
