# **Retail Media API Documentation**

## 1. Summary

This document details the integration with the **Retail Media API**, the central connection point between the VTEX Ads solution and the retailer's (publisher's) platform. The solution was developed under an **API-first** concept, ensuring total flexibility for retailers to integrate and display ads on any digital channel: e-commerce, marketplace, app, or even on physical totems and screens (Digital Signage).

Our architecture is **cookie-less**, meaning we do not rely on third-party cookies. Identification and targeting are based on proprietary identifiers (`user_id`, `session_id`) and first-party data, ensuring a robust solution that complies with new privacy policies and is prepared for the future of digital retail.

Through this REST API, your platform will be able to:
* Synchronize the product catalog and inventory.
* Request relevant ads in real-time for the user's Browse context.
* Send interaction events (impression, view, click, conversion) for performance measurement.

## 2. Glossary

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advertiser** | Companies, sellers, or individuals who promote their products, services, or ideas through campaigns. |
| **Publisher (Retailer)** | The entity that owns and operates the digital platform (website, app) and makes ad spaces available. |
| **Campaign** | An action created by an advertiser to promote products and generate conversions (sales). |
| **Impression** | Counted each time an ad is displayed on the user's screen. |
| **View** | Counted when an impression becomes visible on the user's screen for a specified time. |
| **Click** | User interaction by clicking on an ad to be redirected to the landing page. |
| **Conversion** | A valuable action generated by an ad, typically a sale. |
| **Ad Revenue** | Revenue earned by retailers from monetizing their ad spaces. |
| **Sales Revenue** | Total revenue a company obtains from the sales of products or services. |
| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | Formula: `(Clicks / Impressions) * 100`. Measures the attractiveness of an ad. |
| **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**| Return on Advertising Spend. Formula: `Revenue Generated by Ads / Advertising Cost`. |
| **Conversion Rate** | The percentage of conversions relative to the total number of clicks or visits. |

## 3. Authentication

Authentication is required **only for the product catalog synchronization endpoints**. Other calls, such as ad queries and event notifications, are public and do not require authentication.

For protected endpoints, credentials must be sent via HTTP header. Request your credentials from your account manager.

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-app-id` | Your application's unique ID for the integration. |
| `x-api-key` | API key associated with your application. |

## 4. Main Integration

The integration is based on three pillars that ensure the solution's functionality.

### Integration Pillars

1.  **Catalog:** Keep VTEX Ads synchronized with your product catalog and inventory (price and stock). Essential for product ads.
2.  **Ad Query:** Your platform requests from the API the ads that should be displayed on different pages and contexts.
3.  **Events:** Your platform notifies the API of all user interactions with the ads and, crucially, of conversions (sales).

### Ad Types

| Ad Type | API Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |:------------------------------------------------|
| **Sponsored Products** | `product` | Ads for individual products. |
| **Display Banner** | `banner` | Visual ads (static image or video). |
| **Sponsored Brands** | `sponsored_brand` | Brand ads with a title, logo, and products. (static image or video) |
| **Digital Signage** | `digital_signage`| Content for physical screens and totems. |

### 4.1. Catalog

The first step is synchronization, which occurs on two fronts:

> **Note for VTEX stores:** For stores on the VTEX platform, catalog synchronization occurs transparently, with no additional integration required for this purpose.

        "promotional_price": 119.90,
        "is_available": true
    }
]'
```

#### **Alternative Catalog Integration Methods**

In addition to the REST API, we offer other ways to integrate the catalog:

* **Client's Elasticsearch:** We can connect directly to your Elasticsearch instance.
* **Algolia:** Integration with your existing Algolia account.
* **Google XML:** Support for the standard Google Shopping XML format.

> **Important:** Regardless of the chosen method, all mandatory catalog information must be available in the data source.

### 4.2. Ad Query

With the catalog synchronized, your platform requests ads to fill the ad spaces (`placements`). The request is a `POST` and the `publisher_id` must be provided in the URL.

* **Endpoint:** `POST https://newtail-media.newtail.com.br/v1/rma/:publisher_id`
* **Content-Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

### 4.3. Events

Event notification is **crucial** for attribution and measurement.

#### **User and Session Identification**

* **`session_id`:** User session ID. Required in all events. Must be consistent throughout the Browse session.
* **`user_id`:** Unique customer ID on the platform, consistent across channels. Required in the conversion event.

#### **Impression, View, and Click Notification**

Send a `POST` request to the respective event URL (`impression_url`, `view_url`, `click_url`) provided in the ad query, with a JSON body containing `user_id` and `session_id`.

* **Content-Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* **Recommended Method (Browser):** Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` to ensure asynchronous sending without blocking navigation.
* **Success Response:** `HTTP 202 Accepted`.

#### **Conversion Notification**

When a purchase is completed, send the order data.

* **Endpoint:** `POST https://events.newtail-media.newtail.com.br/v1/beacon/conversion`
* **Content-Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

| `social_id_hashed`| User's Tax ID (CPF/CNPJ) in hash (SHA256). | String | No (Recommended) |

#### **Attribution and Deduplication Rules**

* **Conversion Window:** The period after an interaction during which a sale can be attributed to the ad.
    * **Click (for `product`):** 7 days.
    * **View (for `display`/`video`):** 14 days.
* **Event Deduplication:** For the same user and ad, events are ignored for a period.
    * **Impressions:** 1 minute.
    * **Clicks:** 1 hour.
    * **Conversions:** Are not deduplicated (unless the same `order_id` is sent again within 30 days).

### 4.4. Ad Targeting

Target ads to specific audiences to increase relevance.

#### **Real-Time Targeting**
Send demographic or audience data directly in the body of the **ad query**, in the `segmentation` field.

The `segmentation` field is an array of objects, where each object contains:
- `key`: The type of segmentation (e.g., "STATE", "CITY", "GENDER")
- `values`: Array of values for the segmentation

**Segmentation Example:**

```json
"segmentation": [
    {
        "key": "STATE",
        "values": [
            "CA"
        ]
    },
    {
        "key": "CITY",
        "values": [
            "San Francisco"
        ]
    },
    {
        "key": "NEIGHBOURHOOD",
        "values": [
            "Mission District",
            "SoMa"
        ]
    }
]
```

**Available Segmentation Types:**

| Key | Description | Example Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `STATE` | User's state | "CA", "NY", "TX" |
| `CITY` | User's city | "San Francisco", "New York" |
| `NEIGHBOURHOOD` | User's neighborhood | "Mission District", "Manhattan" |
| `GENDER` | User's gender | "M", "F" |
| `AGE_RANGE` | User's age range | "18-24", "25-34", "35-44" |
| `INCOME_RANGE` | Income bracket | "A", "B1", "B2", "C1", "C2", "DE" |
| `INTEREST` | User's interests | "Sports", "Technology", "Fashion" |
| `CUSTOM_AUDIENCE` | Custom audience | "high_value_customers", "cart_abandoners" |

#### **Audience Data Submission (Batch)**
To create persistent audiences associated with a `user_id`, send data files to an S3 bucket.

* **Format:** `Parquet` with `Snappy` compression.
* **Security (Hashing):** PII data (email, Tax ID, phone, name) must be encrypted with **SHA256** after cleaning (no spaces, lowercase) and normalization (phone in E.164 standard, e.g., `+14155552671`).
* **Attributes:** `CUSTOMER_ID`, `EMAIL_HASHED`, `PHONE_HASHED`, `SOCIAL_ID_HASHED`, `GENDER`, `AGE`, `CITY`, `STATE`, `AUDIENCES`, `NBO_CATEGORIES` (purchase intent categories), etc.

### 4.5. Best Practices

* **HTTP Persistence:** Use persistent HTTP connections (`Connection: keep-alive` in the header) to optimize performance.
* **Timeout:** Implement a timeout of 500-600ms on ad query calls to avoid harming the user experience.
* **Placement Naming:** Adopt a clear standard, such as `{channel}_{context}_{position}_{type}` (e.g., `msite_search_top-shelf_product`).

## 5. Reports and Data Export

### 5.1. Export via API
REST endpoints to extract consolidated reports in JSON (or XLSX with `download=true`).

* `GET /report/v2/advertisers`: Performance by advertiser (publisher's view) [EXAMPLE](../examples/EXPORT_ADVERTISER_DATA.md)
* `GET /report/v2/publishers`: Performance by publisher (advertiser's view) [EXAMPLE](../examples/EXPORT_PUBLISHER_DATA.md)
* `GET /campaign/v2`: Campaign listing report [EXAMPLE](../examples/EXPORT_CAMPAIGNS_LIST_DATA.md)
* `GET /campaign/:id`: Detailed campaign report [EXAMPLE](../examples/EXPORT_CAMPAIGN_DATA.md)
* `GET /ad/results/v2`: Performance report for individual ads  [EXAMPLE](../examples/EXPORT_ADS_DATA.md)

### 5.2. Raw Data Export (via Storage)
We configure daily (D-1) data export to a bucket of your choice (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob).

* **Events (impressions, clicks, conversions):** `Parquet` + `Snappy` files. Deduplication using `event_id` is required.
* **Aggregated Data (campaign, advertiser reports):** `CSV` files.

## 6. Other Integrations

### 6.1. Marketplace Integration
We offer a set of APIs for full integration with Marketplace platforms.

* **Authentication:** Mutual, with the Marketplace using Basic Auth to receive calls from Newtail, and Newtail using `x-app-id`/`x-api-key` to receive calls from the Marketplace.
* **Catalog API:** The Marketplace must expose a `GET /search` endpoint so Newtail can query products by `seller_id`, `name`, `skus`, etc.
* **Management APIs:** Newtail exposes endpoints for the Marketplace to manage Advertisers (`/api/v1/advertisers`), Campaigns (`/api/v1/campaigns`), Metrics (`/api/v1/metrics`), and Credits (`/api/v1/checking_accounts`).
* **Credit Transfer:** API flow to check balance and request the transfer of credits from the seller for ad investment.
* **SSO (Single Sign-On):** API (`POST /sso/marketplace`) that receives user/seller data and returns a redirect URL for automatic login to the Newtail platform.

### 6.2. VTEX Integration (VTEX IO App)
For stores on the VTEX platform, we offer an app that simplifies implementation.

* **Installation:** Add `vendor.newtail-media` as a dependency in `manifest.json`, configure your publisher ID in the admin, and declare the blocks in the theme.
* **Components:**
    * `newtail-media-banner`: Renders banners.
    * `newtail-media-shelf`: Renders a shelf of sponsored products.
    * `newtail-media-search`: Adds "Sponsored" badges to search results.
    * `newtail-media-conversion`: Manages the sending of conversion events.

### 6.3. Integration via Agent
An alternative implementation via script. It consists of including a script in the HTML and adding a `<newtailad>` tag where the ad should be displayed.

### 6.4. Digital Signage Integration
Use the same ad query API with `context: 'digital_signage'` and the mandatory `device_id`.

* **Generic Screens:** Request ads without identifying a user.
* **Screens with Identified User (POS):** Send the `user_id` to receive personalized ads.
* **Response:** The response for `digital_signage` contains an array of `assets` with `url`, `type`, and `duration`, in addition to the `impression_url`.
